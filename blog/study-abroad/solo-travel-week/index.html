        <p>
            The long-anticipated week had finally come! The academic calendar for DIS is structured such that we have two
             different full weeks off from class allocated for travel – one of those weeks you travel with your core course, 
             and one is free for personal travel! I happened to have the first week off from travel, which meant that I was 
             able to spend October 8th to 16th doing what I liked! I had always wanted to do some solo traveling, so I figured 
             this would be as good a time as any to take that leap of faith for the first time. Was I nervous? Absolutely, 
             but the excitement of this new experience, this new challenge, was overpowering. What was my itinerary, you might 
             ask?

        <h2>Split, Croatia</h2>

        <p>
            Split was my first destination and the city where I spent the most time, staying there from Saturday – Tuesday. 
            This was also my first solo hostel experience, which went so much better than I could have ever imagined. I really 
            enjoyed my time in the city, and would absolutely return to Croatia in the future (though I definitely want to go 
            to Dubrovnik before going back to Split). Split was very touristy but not in an oppressive way, and as soon as I 
            was outside the heart of the old town it felt much less crowded and more authentic. Croatia felt fairly similar 
            to Greece climate, topography and vegetation wise, but with its own interesting Roman history and surprisingly 
            well-preserved historical sites. 
        </p>

        <h2><em>Day 1 – Exploring the city</em></h2>

        <p>
            When I first arrived in Split, I dropped my bags at the hostel and set out to explore as much of the old town as 
            I could! I’d say it was a successful first day.

        <h2><em>Day 2 – Road trip to Plitviče Lakes National Park</em></h2>

        <p>
            Today I ventured out with some of my roommates from my hostel to Plitviče Falls National Park, located approximately
            4 hours north of Split. We had to rent a car to get there which was an experience in and of itself (Croatia’s 
            highways are quite pleasant to drive on), and we stopped in the city of Zadar on our way north which was also 
            quite interesting!

        <h2><em>Day 3 – Starigrad Fortress in Omiš</em></h2>

        <p>
            Multiple people recommended that I check out Starigrad Fortress, located in the city of Omiš which was just 
            over 20 minutes south of Split. This 15th fortress is perched atop an ~800 foot high stone ridge overlooking 
            the city with some absolutely stunning views of the Dalmatian coast. The hike to the top was also one of the 
            steepest and most challenging that I’ve ever done.

        <h2><em>Day 4 – Travel to Slovenia</em></h2>

        <p>
            Today was devoted almost entirely to travel, as I had to go all the way from Split, Croatia to Ljubljana, the 
            capital of Slovenia. I wasn’t able to make it all the way to Lake Bled in one day because there wasn’t 
            transportation to get there so late in the evening. I first took a nearly 8-hour train from Split to Zagreb, 
            from which I transferred to a Flixbux for the remaining ~2 hour journey to Ljubljana. Travel went without incident, 
            except for the fact that the train was so criminally slow I swear I could have biked there faster. Oh well. Croatia 
            isn’t known for its rail system.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once in Ljubljana, I stayed in a prison hostel! It was this super crazy hip repurposed prison, where each room 
            was either an old prison cell or other adminstrative space. I got there pretty late, but was delighted to 
            find the lounge and common spaces filled with people and even attended a traditional slovenian music concert in 
            the lobby! Yet another delightful hostel experience.

        <h2>Lake Bled, Slovenia</h2>

        <h2><em>Day 5 – Lake Bled</em></h2>

        <p>
            Today I spent the whole day exploring Lake Bled, in Slovenia. I arrived around 9:30 am by bus and found the town 
            (Bled) utterly empty, which was a delight. After dropping my bags at the hostel, I spent the next several hours 
            walking, napping, and enjoying my solitude as I explored the stunning scenery surrounding me. I felt that Lake 
            Bled was one of the most beautiful areas that I have ever been in my life, and would love to take an extended 
            vacation there where I could fully step away from society. It was so quiet and peaceful, in all the right ways. 
            I think the photos are pretty stunning, but still don’t fully do it justice.

        <h2><em>Day 6 – Leaving Bled and onto Salzburg</em></h2>

        <p>
            I opted to take a train from Bled to Salzburg, and since it didn’t leave until mid-afternoon that left 
            me with a morning to check out some of the other sites near Lake Bled. One that was repeatedly recommended 
            was the Vintgar Gorge, a very picturesque gorge within 30 minutes walk of the hostel that I decided to 
            explore! This hike was the last pleasant part of the day, as I wound up being nearly stranded in the 
            Slovenian countryside because the trail back to my hostel was closed due to forest maintenance and I wound 
            up walking an extra ~5 or so miles before I could find a bus to take me back to Bled. Then a series of 
            train delays led me to miss my connecting train in Austria and I wound up feeling far more stressed than I 
            would have liked. It ultimately worked out, though, and I made it to Salzburg!

        <h2>Salzburg, Austria</h2>

        <h2><em>Day 7 – Salzburg</em></h2>

        <p>
            I didn’t get a great night’s sleep in my hostel in Salzburg and woke up feeling pretty groggy. Not wanting that 
            to stop me, though, I set out to see as much of the historic old town / fortress as I could! Fortunately it was 
            a gorgeous day and the temperature was perfect. I walked through much of the old town on my way to the 
            Hohensalzburg Fortress, perched on a small “mountain” overlooking much of Salzburg. I found the climb up to the 
            fortress to be quite tiring and had to take several breaks along the way (more on this later), but it was overall
            well worth it! There were a series of museums and other things to see, and my visit concluded with a ride down a 
            big funicular which was an interesting experience. Feeling quite tired after this exploration, I headed back to 
            the hostel to hang out for a little while before catching my train to Munich. The train ride was perfectly 
            pleasant, save for the fact that I could feel myself getting more and more exhausted as if my body were beginning 
            to hibernate. I tried to fight through that feeling, though, and was able to make it to my hostel in Munich!

        <h2>Munich, Germany</h2>

        <h2><em>Day 8 – Down bad in Munich</em></h2>

        <p>
            I woke up on Saturday morning in Munich feeling like I’d been hit by a train. I could hardly move, breathing 
            was hard, and I felt like my head was on fire. Unfortunately, I had no choice but to rally and go outside anyways 
            as I needed to get some food in my system and I wanted to try and see some sights. I wound up going to some local 
            coffee shop and ordered up a breakfast sandwich and a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice, thinking that somehow 
            this would miraculously save me. I had purchased tickets the day before to go to the Deutsches Museum, the “world’s 
            largest museum of science and technology”, and was actually really interested in checking this out. While I was 
            walking there, though, I fully realized how ill I was. My body felt so feverish, I couldn’t breathe properly, I 
            think I was the sickest I’d ever been. I made the difficult choice to turn back, and instead seek out the nearest 
            pharmacy to see if I could medicate my way back to health. With paracetamol in hand, I slogged my way back to the 
            hostel to rest and recuperate for the remainder of the day. Fortunately, I had Game of Thrones and Dune to keep me 
            company. *no pictures because I didn’t really go outside :/*
        </p>

        <h2><em>Day 9 – Final day of my trip</em></h2>

        <p>
            Whatever medicating and hydration I had done on Saturday was working wonders, because I woke up Sunday feeling 
            surprisingly better. Far from 100%, but good enough to get out and see at least a bit of the city. I treated myself 
            to an amazing steak and egg breakfast bowl coupled with fresh ginger and orange tea and an incredible belgian waffle, 
            all of which I was able to eat! Hooray for having an appetite! I set out to see some of the old town before catching 
            my flight home, and was glad that I was able to see some things. I got to the airport quite early so I could get 
            situated, rest and relax for a while, and I’m glad I did. I had a perfectly pleasant flight home, and was quite happy 
            to be back in my room in Stockholm that night. And thus concluded my travel adventures.

        <h2>Reflections</h2>

        <p>
            This past week was one of the coolest experiences of my life. I am so grateful to have been able to do this traveling, 
            to have met so many interesting people from all around the world and to have seen so many places that I might not have
            otherwise seen in my life. My study abroad experience has been so much better than I could have ever imagined, and I am
            so excited for all for all of the things that are yet to come. I recognize that there is great privilege in being able 
            to study a semester abroad, but I’ve come to realize the truly immense value that this time abroad provides.
        </p>

        <p>
            Until next time!
        </p>
