						I spent the weekend of Friday September 30th traveling with some friends to Tallinn, the capital of Estonia! 
						Flights there from Stockholm were quite cheap and quite short, so we figured "Why not??" We came into this weekend 
						hoping to have fun, and I’d say it was an absolute success. After getting in late Friday…

						Hello! So sorry! I’ve been busy. Lots of traveling, lots of class, little bit of work :D. The week of Monday,

						With classes now in full swing, life has begun to fill up with work and things so there has

						Hello! This post officially marks the end of my first full week in Stockholm. It’s been an
