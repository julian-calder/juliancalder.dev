        <h2 style="margin-bottom:10px">How to set up and configure your own personal Nextcloud server</h2>
        <p class="date_entry">January 11, 2025</p>

        <p>
            In this tutorial, I am going to walk you through how to configure your own personal Nextcloud server,
            starting from installing Ubuntu server all the way through configuring your router's DNS settings to 
            allow for access to your data from any device, anywhere.
        </p>

        <h2>Requirements:</h2>

        <ul style="line-height: 1.6">
            <li>Linux-compatible device (Raspberry Pi, old laptop, etc.)</li>
            <li>USB Flashdrive with >8GB capacity</li>
            <li>Active ethernet port</li>
            <li>Monitor and keyboard for one-time server setup</li>
            <li>Access to your router (for configuring ports and request routing)</li>
            <li>Access to a domain name with configurable DNS settings (Cloudflare is an inexpensive but reliable option)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step 1: Server installation and configuration</h2>

        <p>
            The first step in getting your own Nextcloud server up and running is to install your server OS of choice 
            on whichever system you are planning to use. I opted to use Ubuntu Server 24.04.1 LTS, as this has several
            years of guaranteed support from Canonical and using Ubuntu gives us native support for the Nextcloud snap, 
            which greatly simplifies the process of setting up Nextcloud.
        </p>

        <h3>Install Ubuntu Server ISO</h3>

        <p>
            The ISO file for Ubuntu Server 24.04.1 LTS can be downloaded from 
            <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/server">Canonical's website</a>. If you are going to run your server 
            on a Raspberry Pi, you will need to make sure you get the ARM-based installer found 
            <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi">here</a>. There are many ways to write this ISO to your
            flashdrive -- I use Fedora Media Writer, but you can also use <a href="https://rufus.ie/en/">Rufus</a>, or 
            the Raspberry Pi Imager if you are going to be running your server off of a Pi.
        </p>

        <p>
            Most of the OS install is fairly straightforward, you just need to pay attention at the stage when you are 
            partitioning your storage drives and remember to expand the LVM group to the full size of the disk. You can 
            read about this on <a href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-server#10-confirm-partitions">
            Canonical's Ubuntu Server install page</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            As you are installing the OS, you will also be presented with the option to import ssh keys with GitHub or 
            Launchpad, which allows the OS to be installed with password authentication disabled (which we will want 
            to do as soon as possible, for security reasons). It's recommended that you do this, because if you don't
            <code>cloud-init</code> will override your PasswordAuthentication setting for sshd and you will have to 
            manually correct its override.
        </p>

        <p>
            The final piece of server configuration is to find out what the local IP address is of the server such that 
            we can access it from other devices on the network, as well as assign it a static IP address from the router
            when we are port forwarding. To find the IP address, you will use 
        </p>
            
        <code class="code_block">
            $ ifconfig
        </code>
        
        <p>
            The output from ifconfig should contain an entry beginning with <code>enp***</code>, indicating the active 
            ethernet connection. In this entry, you should see an IP address labeled <code>inet</code> in the form 
            <code>192.168.*.*</code>, referring to the local IPv4 address of your server. Make note of this IP address 
            for later.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once you have completed this initial configuration, you will need a system restart with <code>sudo 
            reboot</code>. After you have done this, you can unplug any peripherals from your system as the remainder 
            of the server setup can be done from another machine on your local network (via ssh).
        </p>

        <h3>Configure access permissions and local firewall</h3>
        
        <p>
            After the initial setup of the server with a username, hostname and password, you should be able to connect 
            to it via ssh from another device on your network. Ideally, you would have imported the ssh keys such that 
            no password is required to connect. If you didn't do this, though, it's alright! We'll tackle that now. 
            Because password authentication is generally less secure than ssh, the very first thing we are going to do 
            is generate an ssh key on your device and copy it to the server.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            If you didn't copy your ssh keys from GitHub or Launchpad, we will need to use <code>ssh-copy-id</code> to 
            do it. If you haven't already generated an ssh key on your system, you can run the following command to do so:
        </p>

        <code class="code_block">
            $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
        </code>

        <p>
            This command generates a 4096-bit ssh key with RSA encryption. You can read more about this command from 
            the <a href="https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/keygen">ssh academy page</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you had previously generated an ssh key, you would see it in <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code>
        </p>

        <p>
            Next, we use <code>ssh-copy-id</code> to send the key to our server. This will require you to connect with 
            the same username and password that you configured as the administrative account on the server.
        </p>

        <code class="code_block">
            $ ssh-copy-id user@hostname
        </code>

        <p>
            This will create an <code>authorized_keys</code> file in the <code>~/.ssh/</code> directory on the server, 
            making the connection from your system to the server. If your system username matches the one configured 
            as admin on the server, you can omit the <code>user@</code> portion of the command
        </p>

        <p>
            Once we have done this, we need to <strong>disable password authentication</strong>. Head to 
            <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> in your editor of choice (and sudo) and look for 
            <code>PasswordAuthentication</code>. Change this from yes to no.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is possible that there are other files which are trying to overwrite your <code>sshd_config</code> file. 
            Specifically, check that <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*</code> doesn't have password authentication enabled. 
            If it does, make sure to set this value to no as well. If you didn't pre-populate an ssh key with GitHub or 
            Launchpad, <code>cloud-init</code> tends to add an override here to allow password authentication so you 
            have some way to access the server remotely. Since you've now added an ssh key to this server, you want to 
            remove this password access override.
        </p>

        <p>
            From this point onward, all configuration will be happening on the server (via ssh), *not* on your personal 
            device (unless otherwise specified).
        </p>

        <h2>Step 2: Firewall configuration and initial Nextcloud setup</h2>

        <h3>Configuring firewall rules with ufw</h3>

        <p>
            <code>ufw</code> (uncomplicated firewall) is a popular program which allows the user to manage which ports 
            on their machine are accessible to other devices on their network. Because Nextcloud operates over the 
            internet (and utilizes a web interface), it will need access to the http and https ports (80 and 443). 
            Additionally, since we want our server to be accessible from other devices on the local network and enabling
            <code>ufw</code> would protect all unspecified ports, we also need to allow connections via ssh (port 22) 
            such that we don't kick ourselves off of the server unintentionally.
        </p>

        <p>
            <code>ufw</code> is installed (but inactive) by default on Ubuntu, and you can check your status with:
        </p>

        <code class="code_block">
            $ sudo ufw status
        </code>

        <p>
            Once you have verified that <code>ufw</code> is installed, we will add the rules to allow ssh, http and https:
        </p>

        <code class="code_block">
            $ sudo ufw allow ssh <br>
            $ sudo ufw allow http <br>
            $ sudo ufw allow https
        </code>

        <p>
            Once we have configured the firewall, we need to enable it and ensure that it is working properly:
        </p>

        <code class="code_block">
            $ sudo ufw enable <br>
            $ sudo ufw reload <br>
            $ sudo ufw status
        </code>

        <p>
            You should then see an output indicating that your firewall is active and ports 22, 80, and 443 are open.
        </p>

        <h3>Initializing Nextcloud admin account</h3>

        <p>
            We will be installing the <a href="https://github.com/nextcloud-snap/nextcloud-snap">Nextcloud snap</a>, 
            as it is well supported on Ubuntu and contains useful features for generating and restoring server backups.
        </p>

        <p>
            First we install the Nextcloud snap with 
        </p>

        <code class="code_block">
            $ sudo snap install nextcloud
        </code>

        <p>
            Next, we need to initialize an admin account for Nextcloud using the IP address of the server that we took 
            note of in step 1 <code>(192.168.*.*)</code>. On your non-server system, type the local IP address of the 
            server into your web browser and you should see a Nextcloud login page. This is because Nextcloud is 
            listening on ports 80 and 443 by default, and accessing it over the web (even just over the local network) 
            creates a connection with http (or https, if there are ssl certificates). The username and password that you
            enter here will be the administrator of the server.
        </p>

        <p>
            We do this now before we port forward for security reasons. If we port forward first, there is the chance 
            that an outside user could create an admin account before us on the server. Additionally, once we configure 
            nginx with a reverse proxy it will only handle client requests properly if accessed via the full web domain 
            (<code>cloud.domainname.com</code>), not from a local IP address. We will talk more about how nginx works in 
            step 3.
        </p>

        <h3>Modifying Nextcloud server configuration</h3>

        <p>
            Once we have created our Nextcloud admin account by accessing the local IP address of the server, we need to
            change the http and https ports Nextcloud listens on since nginx itself listens on ports 80 and 443. 
        </p>

        <code class="code_block">
            $ sudo snap set nextcloud ports.http=81 ports.https=444
        </code>

        <p>
            It is important that you update the list of trusted domains from which you are going to access Nextcloud. 
            Regardless of whether you will host Nextcloud from a custom domain (<code>cloud.domainname.com</code>) or from
            your router's reverse DNS (<code>yourdomain.tplinkdns.net</code>) (see step 4), you will need to specify 
            that address here.
        </p>

        <code class="code_block">
            $ sudo snap run nextcloud.occ config:system:set trusted_domains 1 --value=https://cloud.domainname.com
        </code>

        <p>
            Additionally, since we are using nginx to proxy requests to our Nextcloud server, we will need to add 
            <code>localhost (127.0.0.1)</code> to our list of trusted proxies
        </p>

        <code class="code_block">
            $ sudo snap run nextcloud.occ config:system:set trusted_proxies 0 --value=127.0.0.1
        </code>

        <h2>Step 3: nginx site configuration</h2>

        <p>
            After adjusting our Nextcloud ports, we now need to configure nginx to operate as a reverse proxy to 
            appropriately handle client requests and ensure that users are being served the expected content. We will 
            go into the specifics of how and why we are using nginx now.
        </p>

        <h3>An introduction to proxies</h3>

        <p>
            Forward and reverse proxies are the two primary ways in which device communications over the internet can 
            be monitored and controlled. A <strong>forward proxy</strong>, commonly referred to simply as a proxy, sits 
            between users on a local network and the outside internet and acts on behalf of the internal clients, 
            forwarding their requests to external servers. The normal workflow of a forward proxy is as follows:
        </p>

        <ol style="line-height: 1.6">
            <li>Internal users make a request to the proxy</li>
            <li>The proxy forwards the request to external servers</li>
            <li>External servers see the proxy as the client</li>
            <li>Proxy returns response back to the internal client</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            A <strong>reverse proxy</strong>, on the other hand, sits between external clients and an internal server 
            and acts on behalf of the server to process the incoming requests from external clients. A reverse 
            proxy works as follows:
        </p>

        <ol style="line-height: 1.6">
            <li>External user makes request to what they think is the final server</li>
            <li>Reverse proxy receives the request</li>
            <li>Proxy forward request to appropriate internal server</li>
            <li>Internal server processes request and returns response through the proxy back to the client</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Essentially, the biggest difference between forward and reverse proxies is the direction of their protection:
            forward proxies protect internal clients from external resources, while reverse proxies protect internal 
            servers from external clients.
        </p>

        <h3>nginx as a reverse proxy</h3>

        <p>
            For our Nextcloud server, we use nginx as a reverse proxy for many reasons:
        </p>

        <ol style="line-height: 1.6">
            <li>Getting SSL certificates for an nginx reverse proxy is simple, and much easier than integrating https 
                into Nextcloud directly</li>
            <li>It's an easy way to redirect all traffic to be SSL-encrypted (with https)</li>
            <li>The reverse proxy allows us to run more than one type of webserver on the same machine, and nginx 
                will redirect the incoming requests to the appropriate backend based on the URL of the content being 
                accessed
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Installing and configuring nginx</h3>

        <p>
            We begin by installing nginx with
        </p>

        <code class="code_block">
            $ sudo apt install nginx
        </code>

        <p>
            Next, we need to create a site in <code>/etc/nginx/sites-available/</code>, which we are going to call 
            <code>cloud</code>. This will allow us to access Nextcloud from the web using <code>cloud.domainname.com</code>
            . Note that creating and modifying this file will require sudo.
        </p>

        <code class="code_block">
            server { <br>
                <div>
                server_name cloud.domainname.com; # modify this to match the domain name of your server!<br>
                <br> 
                listen 80; <br>
                <br>
                location / { <br>
                    <div>
                    proxy_pass http://localhost:81; <br>
                    proxy_set_header Host $http_host; <br>
                    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; <br>
                    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; <br>
                    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme; <br>
                    proxy_redirect off; <br>
                    </div>
                } <br>
                <br>
                fastcgi_request_buffering off; <br>
                client_max_body_size 2048m; <br>
                </div>
            }
        </code>

        <p>
            You must enable your site by creating a link from sites-available to sites-enabled with 
        </p>

        <code class="code_block">
            $ sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/cloud /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
        </code>

        <p>
            and ensure that nginx is running with 
        </p>

        <code class="code_block">
            $ sudo systemctl enable nginx <br>
            $ sudo systemctl restart nginx
        </code>

        <h2>Step 4: Port forwarding and DNS configuration</h2>

        <p>
            Before we can do certbot, we need to forward our http and https ports on the router so that connections 
            outside of the local network have access to your Nextcloud server. This will require you to log into your 
            router, likely through 192.168.1.1 or something similar. The "default gateway" entry in your device network
            settings will likely point you to the local IP address of your router. 
        </p>

        <p>
            From your router, go the the WAN settings and find port forwarding. You will want to forward ports 80 and 
            443 on the local IP address corresponding to the device on which your Nextcloud server is running. If your 
            router asks for a choice on which protocol, TCP is just fine.
        </p>

        <p>
            You will also need to set up reverse DNS here, so that you know the IP address of your house. Many routers 
            support this feature with something called Dynamic Domain Name System (DDNS), granting you access to the 
            router with a registered domain name like <code>yourdomain.tplinkdns.net</code> or 
            <code>yourdomain.asuscomm.com</code>. If your router has this feature, set it up. Otherwise, there are 3rd 
            party services which provide a similar reverse DNS functionality.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you already have a domain name (which you should, since they are quite useful and inexpensive), you can 
            use it here to create a CNAME record for <code>cloud.domainname.com</code> which points to 
            <code>yourdomain.tplinkdns.net</code> or whatever your reverse DNS address is. If you don't have a domain 
            name and don't want to buy one, you can change the hostname in your nginx configuration to be your reverse 
            DNS address. You are limited to hosting only one webserver per reverse DNS address, though, but it will 
            work. Domain names are only ~$12/year, so I would recommend acquiring one. I use Cloudflare for 
            <code>juliancalder.dev</code>, and it works great.

        <h2>Step 5: certbot configuration</h2>

        <p>
            We use certbot to easily generate signed SSL certificates for our sites, allowing browsers to authenticate 
            over HTTPS thus encrypting data to and from the site. First, we must ensure we have certbot installed with
        </p>

        <code class="code_block">
            $ sudo snap install certbot --classic
        </code>

        <p>
            Note that if you aren't on Ubuntu, you have to make sure you have set up the symlink to allow classic snaps 
            to be in your path -- see <a href="https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd">the snap documentation here</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Certbot will look for any websites accessible over http and give you a list from which you can choose which 
            ones you want to generate SSL certificates for. You can run the command below and it should automatically 
            detect and generate certificates for your site, after which time your site should be securely accessible 
            at <code>cloud.yourdomain.com</code>
        </p>

        <code class="code_block">
            $ sudo certbot --nginx
        </code>

        <h2>Step 6 (optional): Importing a Nextcloud backup</h2>

        <p>
            The snap version of Nextcloud has a very useful feature enabling you to import a backup of a preexisting 
            server, making it much easier to migrate your server to new hardware (as I did when upgrading from a 
            Raspberry Pi to my new 2700x-powered system). You can import the backup with
        </p>

        <code class="code_block">
            $ sudo nextcloud.import /path/to/your/backup
        </code>

        <p>
            Before you do this, though, it is important that you verify that your backup is somewhere the Nextcloud 
            snap can read it, and that the backup is owned by root. Snaps are fully sandboxed applications, so they are 
            self-contained applications which only have access to the files and resources they need to operate. The 
            Nextcloud snap only has access to the internet and the ability to bind to a port, and importantly does not
            have access to the filesystem outside of its own namespace (including <code>/var/snap/nextcloud/</code>). 
            Therefore, you need to move your backup to somewhere in the filesystem that Nextcloud will be able to
            access it
        </p>

        <code class="code_block">
            $ sudo mv /path/to/your/backup /var/snap/nextcloud/common/backup <br>
            $ sudo chown -R root:root /var/snap/nextcloud/common/backup
        </code>

        <p>
            It may take a while to restore this backup depending on the size of the file, but once it is finished you 
            should be able to use your devices syncing to the server without any interruptions. Once your backup has 
            been imported, you can safely delete it (unless you want to hold onto it for some reason).
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>
            If you followed the steps above, you should now have an operational Nextcloud server! Depending on your 
            operating system, there are different Nextcloud desktop applications which will allow you to fairly 
            seamlessly integrate this cloud backup functionality into your existing desktop ecosystem. If possible, 
            I would recommend making symlinks from <code>Nextcloud/Documents, Pictures, Music, etc</code> to your 
            home directory to take full advantage of the integration.
        </p>

        <p>
            Note that it could take some time to sync all of your files the first time your server becomes operational. 
            I've had success syncing all of my files from my primary system, and then using a command like 
            <code>rsync</code> to transfer my files to other systems on my home network to take full advantage of 
            hardware-limited ethernet transfer speeds.
