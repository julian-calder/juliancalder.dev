			<strong> <a href="../papers/704_paper.pdf"> Classifying quantum states of matter with machine learning</a> </strong> <br>
			<em> Middlebury College Department of Physics | Middlebury, VT</em> <br>
			<em class="date_entry">Feb 2024 – May 2024 </em> <br>
			<br>
			Historically, a one-semester senior project was a requirement for all physics majors at Middlebury. While my graduating class 
			was the first to have this requirement lifted, I still opted to pursue a project which would allow me to combine my interests
			in physics and computer science in a more applied setting than any previous coursework had allowed. My research explored the 
			implementation of various neural network architectures in classifying simulated magnetic materials as ferromagnetic or paramagnetic,
			as indicated by whether the simulated spin configurations corresponded to a system that was above or below the transition temperature.
			I worked exclusively in Jupyter notebooks, using the TensorFlow ML framework which I found to be quite approachable yet also
			powerful enough to conduct this interesting research. This was my first dive into any kind of machine learning architectures, 
			and I am quite happy with how it turned out. <br>

			<strong> <a href="../papers/layered_inverter.pdf"> Fabrication of a novel multi-layer electric vehicle half-bridge inverter module</a> </strong> <br>
			<em> National Renewable Energy Laboratory | Golden, CO</em> <br>
			<em class="date_entry">Jun 2023 – Aug 2023 </em> <br>
			<br>
			I returned to NREL in the summer of 2023 working as a SULI in the Advanced Power Electronics and Electric Machines group. I developed a comprehensive GUI application with Tkinter in Python to control and automate 
			a custom-made hot press being used to fabricate a new kind of power inverter module for electric vehicles. I designed the program to be as intuitive and efficient as possible while also minimizing the amount of 
			user input required. Preliminary modules produced with this updated press program demonstrated successful program operation, highlighting future areas of improvement in the fabrication process.
			During this time at NREL I also helped develop a general-purpose data acquisition program in Python designed to be distributed laboratory-wide, implementing a suite of programmable sensors and
			controllers produced by <a href="https://www.phidgets.com/">Phidget</a>. <br>

			<strong> <a href="../papers/layered_deposition.pdf">Installation, calibration, and experimental verification of a layered deposition scheme</a> </strong> <br>
			<em> National Renewable Energy Laboratory | Golden, CO </em> <br>
			<em class="date_entry">May 2022 – Aug 2022</em> <br>
			<br>
			I spent the summer of 2022 working in the Materials Discovery group at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory as part of the DOE-sponsored 
			Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internship (SULI) program. My research primarily involved the attempted synthesis of a newly-reported ternary nitride crystal 
			structure <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.chemmater.1c03014">previously discovered by the PI of the research group</a>. 
			Much of my work focused on the growth of Zinc Titanium Nitride (ZnTiN2) and Magnesium Tungsten Nitride (MgWN2) thin films using a high-vacuum magnetron
			sputter deposition chamber and running subsequent characterization measurements on the films using techniques such as profilometry (to measure film thickness),
			X-ray fluorescence (to determine the molecular composition), and X-ray diffraction (to identify the crystal structure of the film). <br>
