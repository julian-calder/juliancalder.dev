		<h3 class="album_title"> Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park</h3>
		<span class="album_dates"> 2023, Aug 14-16 </span>
		<p>
			I spent my last few days in Colorado camping in Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park, located in west-central Colorado. We camped two nights, 
			one on each side of the canyon. The park was beautiful well worth the visit, though three days was definitely enough time to see everything in the park. We rounded 
			off our adventure by seeing The Head and the Heart and Father John Misty in Vail!

		<h3 class="album_title"> Great Sand Dunes National Park</h3>
		<span class="album_dates"> 2023, Aug 4-5 </span>
		<p>
			I drove down to Great Sand Dunes National Park on Friday, and because it was the anniversary of the passing of the <a href="https://www.doi.gov/gaoa">Great American Outdoors Act</a> entrance to the park was free!
			We arrived just before sunset and had the spectacular experience of hiking up to the top of the highest dune as the sun was going down. The lack of moonlight made for the
			most amazing night of stargazing that I've ever had. Absolutely worth the visit.

		<h3 class="album_title"> Gray's Peak</h3>
		<span class="album_dates"> 2023, Jul 16 </span>
		<p>
			I spent my weekend visiting a friend in the beautiful mountain town of Frisco, CO. To fulfill my request to "hike a big mountain", we set out at 4:30 am
			to hike the back side of Gray's peak, one of Colorado's more popular 14ers. While the day definitely got away from us and the hike took many more hours 
			than anticipated, we saw tons of wildlife and had a lovely time regardless.

		<h3 class="album_title"> Rocky Mountain National Park</h3>
		<span class="album_dates"> 2023, Jul 8 </span>
		<p>
			I was invited to join a friend on a day trip to Rocky Mountain National Park to hike <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/colorado/east-inlet-trail-to-lone-pine-lake?search=true">Lone Pine Lake via East Inlet Trail</a>.
			In spite of the brutally early morning and accompanying lack of sleep, this was a really beautiful hike and my first time in RMNP in almost ten years!

		<h3 class="album_title"> Arches and Canyonlands National Parks  </h3>
		<span class="album_dates"> 2023, Jun 16-19 </span>
		<p>
			A few interns and I took a spontaneous trip to Moab to see both Arches and Canyonlands national parks, bringing my total number visited to 10! 
			This trip vastly exceeded my expectations, and I was lucky to see (and document) some of the most breathtaking landscapes I've ever seen.
